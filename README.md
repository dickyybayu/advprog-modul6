## Commit 1 Reflection Notes
### Handle Connection and Response

In this milestone 1, I implemented the handle_connection function to process incoming TCP streams. This method reads HTTP requests from clients using a buffered reader, collects the request lines, and prints them to the console. By handling connections in a structured manner, the server can properly interpret incoming requests and prepare responses.

Throughout this process, I gained a deeper understanding of Rust's standard library, particularly its BufReader and iterator methods. Implementing the request-handling logic helped me reinforce my knowledge of error handling, method chaining, and functional programming concepts in Rust.
